XamForms.ButtonIssue
==========

Simple example of an issue with Xamarin forms.

Issue:

A button inside a contentpage will stop animating when clicked on after it has been pushed onto the navigation stack with PushAsync().

Currently only tested on iOS with Xamarin.Forms 1.2.
Unfortunately not tested on actual device.
